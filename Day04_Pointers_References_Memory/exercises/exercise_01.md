# Exercise 01: Swap with Pointers

## Task
Read two integers and swap them using pointers. Print the values after swapping.

## Input
Two integers `a` and `b`.

## Output
The swapped values in the order `a b`.

## Example
Input:
```
7 3
```
Output:
```
3 7
```

## Notes
Use two pointers that point to the variables, then swap through dereferencing.

## Concept Focus
- Pointer dereference
- Swapping via indirection

## Constraints (Suggested)
- Values fit in `int`

## Approach
Use pointers to access and swap the two values.

## Edge Cases
- Same values for both inputs

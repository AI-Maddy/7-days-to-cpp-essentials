# Exercises

Solve each problem using STL containers.

## How to Solve
Pick the container that best matches the problem: order, frequency, or lookup.

## List
- `exercise_01.md` - Count distinct numbers
- `exercise_02.md` - Frequency map of numbers
- `exercise_03.md` - First repeating element
- `exercise_04.md` - Check if two strings are anagrams

## Workflow
1. Pick the container that matches the goal (order vs speed).
2. Solve with the simplest container first.
3. Optimize only if needed.

## Common Mistakes
- Assuming unordered containers are sorted
- Using the wrong key type in maps

## Mini-FAQ
**Q: Should I use `map` or `unordered_map`?**
A: Use `map` when you need sorted output; otherwise prefer `unordered_map`.

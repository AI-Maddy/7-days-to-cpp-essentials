## How to Learn From Solutions
Notice which containers were chosen and why. Pay attention to complexity.

## Common Mistakes
- Using ordered containers for simple counting
- Assuming unordered containers keep order

## Mini-FAQ
**Q: Is `unordered_map` always better?**
A: Not always; ordering and worst-case performance may matter.

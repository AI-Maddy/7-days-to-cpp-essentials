# Exercises

Practice functions, recursion, and lambdas.

## How to Solve
Write a small helper function first, then use it inside `main()`.

## List
- `exercise_01.md` - GCD using recursion
- `exercise_02.md` - Power using recursion
- `exercise_03.md` - Count digits recursively
- `exercise_04.md` - Print even numbers using a lambda

## Workflow
1. Write a helper function with a clear base case.
2. Test with small inputs first.
3. Consider overflow for large results.

## Common Mistakes
- Missing base cases in recursion
- Returning wrong types (int vs long long)

## Mini-FAQ
**Q: Can I use loops instead of recursion?**
A: Only if the exercise does not explicitly require recursion.

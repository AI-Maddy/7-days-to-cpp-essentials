# Exercise 02: Count Vowels

## Task
Read a line of text and count how many vowels it contains.

## Input
A single line of text (may include spaces).

## Output
A single integer: the number of vowels in the line.

## Example
Input:
```
hello world
```
Output:
```
3
```

## Notes
Count both lowercase and uppercase vowels: a, e, i, o, u.

## Concept Focus
- String traversal
- Character classification

## Constraints (Suggested)
- Line length up to $10^5$

## Approach
Scan each character and increment a counter when it is a vowel.

## Edge Cases
- Empty line
- Mixed case input

# Examples

Short programs to practice arrays, strings, and vectors.

## How to Use
Run each example and trace the loops. Pay attention to indices and sizes.

## Files
- `example_01.cpp` - Sum of elements in a fixed array
- `example_02.cpp` - String length and concatenation
- `example_03.cpp` - Vector push/pop and size
- `example_04.cpp` - Find max value in a vector

## Build and Run
```bash
g++ example_01.cpp -o example_01
./example_01
```

## What to Observe
- Index boundaries and loop conditions
- Differences between arrays and vectors
- String concatenation and length

## Common Mistakes
- Off-by-one errors in loops
- Assuming vectors are fixed-size

## Mini-FAQ
**Q: Why use vectors instead of arrays?**
A: Vectors manage memory and resize safely.

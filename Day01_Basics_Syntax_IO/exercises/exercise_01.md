# Exercise 01: Sum Two Numbers

## Task
Read two integers and print their sum.

## Input
Two integers `a` and `b` separated by space.

## Output
A single integer: the sum of `a` and `b`.

## Example
Input:
```
3 9
```
Output:
```
12
```

## Notes
Use `int` for this problem. This exercise checks basic input and output.

## Concept Focus
- Reading input and printing output
- Integer arithmetic

## Constraints (Suggested)
- $-10^9 <= a, b <= 10^9$

## Approach
Read two integers, add them, and print the result.

## Edge Cases
- Negative values
- Large values within range

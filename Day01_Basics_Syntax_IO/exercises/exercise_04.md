# Exercise 04: Rectangle Area and Perimeter

## Task
Read length and width of a rectangle, then print its area and perimeter.

## Input
Two numbers: `length` and `width`.

## Output
Two values:
1. Area
2. Perimeter

## Example
Input:
```
5 3
```
Output:
```
15 16
```

## Notes
Area is `length * width`. Perimeter is `2 * (length + width)`.
Use `double` to support non-integer values.

## Concept Focus
- Using formulas with multiple outputs
- Floating-point input

## Constraints (Suggested)
- $0 <= length, width <= 10^6$

## Approach
Compute area and perimeter and print them in order.

## Edge Cases
- Zero dimensions

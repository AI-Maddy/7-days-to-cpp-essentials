# Exercises

Solve each problem using basic I/O, variables, and arithmetic.
Write your solution in a new `.cpp` file or compare with the provided solution.

## How to Solve
Read input from standard input and print only what is requested. Use simple
variables and avoid extra prompts in the output.

## List
- `exercise_01.md` - Sum of two numbers
- `exercise_02.md` - Fahrenheit to Celsius
- `exercise_03.md` - Simple interest calculator
- `exercise_04.md` - Rectangle area and perimeter

## Workflow
1. Read the task and identify inputs/outputs.
2. Write a minimal solution and test with the sample.
3. Try one extra test of your own.

## Common Mistakes
- Printing prompts that are not requested by the exercise
- Using integer division when decimals are required

## Mini-FAQ
**Q: Should I format decimals?**
A: Use `fixed` and `setprecision` only if the task requires it.

# 7‑Days‑to‑CPP‑Essentials  
A focused, high‑impact learning path designed to teach **modern C++ (C++17/20)** specifically for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **competitive programming**.

This is not a full C++ course.  
It is a **DSA‑ready C++ bootcamp** — the exact features you need, nothing you don’t.

If you already know C, Python, or Java, this 7‑day track will get you productive in C++ faster than any traditional course.

---

## 🎯 What You Will Learn
By the end of 7 days, you will be able to:

- Write clean, modern C++ code  
- Use STL containers (`vector`, `set`, `map`, `unordered_map`, etc.)  
- Use pointers and references safely  
- Write recursive functions and lambdas  
- Build simple classes and structs for DSA nodes  
- Use templates and fast I/O for competitive programming  
- Solve DSA problems efficiently in C++  

This prepares you perfectly for the next step:

## ✅ How to Use This Repo
1. Start with Day 01 and read the day README.
2. Run examples from `examples/` to see concepts in action.
3. Solve exercises in `exercises/` before opening solutions.
4. Compare your solution with `solutions/` and take notes.

## 🧪 Build and Run
From any examples or solutions folder:

```bash
g++ example_01.cpp -o example_01
./example_01
```

Use `-std=c++17` or `-std=c++20` if needed:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 example_01.cpp -o example_01
```

## 📌 Conventions
- Inputs are read from standard input.
- Outputs should match the exercise format exactly.
- Avoid extra prompts when submitting solutions.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
- Mixing `getline` and `cin >>` without consuming newlines.
- Integer division where you expected decimals.
- Out-of-bounds access with arrays and vectors.

## ❓ FAQ
**Q: Can I skip a day?**
A: It is best to follow the order because each day builds on the previous one.

**Q: Should I always use `using namespace std;`?**
A: It is convenient for learning, but many projects avoid it for clarity.

**Q: Do I need fast I/O for all tasks?**
A: Only for large inputs; Day 07 covers when and how to use it.

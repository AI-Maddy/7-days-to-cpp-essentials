# Exercises

Practice classes and structs for DSA.

## How to Solve
Start with the data structure design, then add methods and test small inputs.

## List
- `exercise_01.md` - Insert at head and print a linked list
- `exercise_02.md` - Point class and distance to origin
- `exercise_03.md` - Queue using linked list nodes
- `exercise_04.md` - Bank account class

## Workflow
1. Sketch the class or struct design first.
2. Implement core methods and test with small inputs.
3. Add cleanup logic for dynamic memory.

## Common Mistakes
- Forgetting to update head/tail pointers
- Leaving memory leaks in linked structures

## Mini-FAQ
**Q: Should I make members public or private?**
A: Use private for data, public for methods.
